# CSCE 474: Data Mining Team Project
Instructions to Run Files:
WeatherKNN.py, WeatherNaiveBayes.py, WeatherRandomForest.py, and WeatherNN.py may require you to install the necessary packages. Also, to run the different sampling methods, you will need to comment/uncomment some code sections. See comments in the files.

To run the clustering algorithm, simply enter the k value that you want to produce and alter the data = data[data['Severity'] == 4] line to whatever severity you want to analyze. Both of these are found in the second cell

Then all you need to do is run all the Jupyter Cells

The road classification files are similar to the weather classification, the main difference being they run in a Jupyter notebook. Comment and uncomment the cells with the various sampling methods to use them, and otherwise run each cell.
